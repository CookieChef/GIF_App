# Giphy_App

This is a basic jquery app that uses an ajax call to get a response from an API. It then searches for the elements needed (image, image still, image active, and rating) and displays them. When the user clicks on an image this will change the state of the image to be either active or still. 

The app starts off with a basic array of animals the user can click on and get a max result of 5 giphs or the user can add their own query.

When the user searches for a new animal this will then create a button for the animal and pushes the new animal to the starting array. This will allow the user to add more animals and toggle giphs between them. 

The new animal button will not empty if the user click on a button or searches for a new animal. To start over the user must refresh the page.
